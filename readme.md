# Global Genome Biodiversity Network

_\[From the [GGBN Wiki](https://wiki.ggbn.org/ggbn/About_GGBN)\]_ 

> The Global Genome Biodiversity Network is an international network of institutions that share an interest in long-term preservation of genomic samples representing the diversity of non-human life on Earth. GGBN provides a platform for biodiversity biobanks from across the world to:
>
> - Collaborate to ensure consistent quality standards for DNA and tissue collections,
> - Improve best practices for the preservation and use of such collections and
> - Harmonize exchange and use of material in accordance with national and international legislation and conventions.
>
> The Global Genome Biodiversity Network provides its members with the primary benefit of making their DNA and tissue collections discoverable for research through a networked community of biodiversity biobanks. In doing so, GGBN provides trusted and transparent access to genomic samples for all, through an access and benefit sharing framework.

To mobilize data about samples held in biorepositories, the GGBN consortium has created a data standard as an extension of the existing and widely used TDWG standards for biodviersity specimens, [ABCD](https://abcd.tdwg.org) and [Darwin Core](https://dwc.tdwg.org). The GGBN data standard was published in 2016 and has been operationally by the full network since then. The joint TDWG and GSC interest group on [Genomic Biodiversity](https://www.tdwg.org/community/gbwg) has now proposed the GGBN data standard for ratification as a TDWG standard. The TDWG ratification process has two phases, expert review followed by an public review of not less than 30 days. The GGBN data standard has passed expert review and the period for public comment is now open. Public review will be open until August 1, 2020. This repository serves as the forum for the public review. 

## Making comments

 - To make a public comment, please create an "issue" in this repository (second tab from the left at the top of this page). You will need a GitHub account to post an issue. 

 - To make an anonymous comment, please send email to the [TDWG Secretariat](mailto:secretariat@tdwg.org) describing your concern as thorughly as you can. The secretariat with work with you to ensure that your comment is understandable and communicated anonymously to the authors of the standard.
